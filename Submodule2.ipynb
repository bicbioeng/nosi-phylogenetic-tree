    "### **2.4 Let‚Äôs Do an Example: Downloading SARS-CoV-2 Data from NCBI**\n",
    "To help you get started, let‚Äôs walk through an example of downloading SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data from NCBI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Access NCBI Virus Database**\n",
    "1. Open your web browser and go to the [NCBI Virus Website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/)\n",
    "2. The homepage will show a search bar and various filtering options.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Step 2: Search for SARS-CoV-2 Sequences**\n",
    "1. In the search bar, type *Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2*, or use the `taxonomy ID: 2697049`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the filters on the left sidebar to refine your search:\n",
    "   - **Geographic Region**: Scroll down to the Geographic Region section in the left sidebar. Click on Search All Geo Locations, then expand the list for USA. From the USA list, select your specific state or region. For this example, select South Dakota (SD).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Collection Date** (Optional): Select a date range, such as 2023-01-01 to 2023-03-31, to include only sequences collected within a specific timeframe. \n",
    "     ***Note***:\n",
    "              Choosing a larger date range will result in more data, which may require more computational resources to process. For example:\n",
    "     1. A full year's data will generate a significantly larger dataset, requiring multi-core CPUs and at least 16GB of RAM to handle alignment or phylogenetic analysis efficiently.\n",
    "     2. Selecting a smaller date range, such as two months (e.g., 2023-01-01 to 2023-02-28), will produce a smaller dataset that can execute faster and work well on machines with limited resources.\n",
    "   ***It's recommended to tailor your date range based on the scope of your analysis and the computational power available.***\n",
    "   - **Sequence Type**: Choose \"Nucleotide\" for genomic sequence\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Step 3: Select the Desired Sequences**\n",
    "1. Look through the search results and check the metadata, like location, collection date, or lineage, to make sure the sequences match your needs.\n",
    "2. If you want to select specific sequences, click the checkbox next to them.\n",
    "3. Alternatively, let‚Äôs say I select all sequences instead of individual ones. In this case, I can skip selecting specific checkboxes and go directly to the Download button at the top of the page. This will include all sequences from the filtered search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Download the Sequences**\n",
    "1. Click the Download button at the top of the page.\n",
    "2. After clicking the Download button, a new window will appear, as shown in the screenshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In Step 1 of 3, select Nucleotide under the Sequence Data (FASTA format) option. This ensures that the downloaded file contains nucleotide sequences in the standard FASTA format, which is commonly used for bioinformatics analyses.\n",
    "4. Click Next to proceed.\n",
    "5. Choose Download All Records to include all the filtered sequences (e.g., 554 records in this example). Alternatively, you can choose Download Selected Records if you have manually selected specific sequences in the results list.\n",
    "6. After making your choice, click Next to proceed.\n",
    "7. In this final step, you‚Äôll be asked to choose the FASTA definition line format.\n",
    "8. Select the Use default option, which includes the Accession and GenBank Title, to proceed with standard formatting for the downloaded sequences.\n",
    "9. Click the Download button to save the FASTA file to your system.\n",

    "The question of why we download data in FASTA format instead of other formats often arises. FASTA is a widely accepted standard format for storing biological sequences, providing only the sequence data without additional metadata like quality scores. This makes it lightweight and easy to work with, especially for tasks like sequence alignment and reference-based analysis. Additionally, FASTA files are universally supported by most bioinformatics tools and workflows. Other formats, such as FASTQ, include quality scores but are larger and primarily used for raw sequencing data, which may not always be necessary for downstream analyses. The simplicity and accessibility of FASTA make it the preferred choice for many applications.\n",

    "In this module, we focused on the critical first step in constructing phylogenetic trees: data collection. Learners were introduced to retrieving sequence data from various sources, such as NCBI, KEGG, and UniProt, using appropriate database queries and APIs. We explored methods for interacting with these databases, fetching relevant sequence data, and subsetting it for further analysis. Additionally, we provided an overview of the FASTA file format, demonstrating its structure and significance in bioinformatics. By examining the contents of a FASTA file, learners gained a better understanding of how sequence data is organized and prepared for downstream analysis. This module sets the stage for the next step in phylogenetic analysis, where we will perform sequence alignment and explore different algorithms and tools for constructing phylogenetic trees.\n",
