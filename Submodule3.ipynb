    "For constructing a phylogenetic tree, we use USHER (Ultrafast Sample placement on Existing tRee). USHER is a bioinformatics tool specifically designed to place new genetic sequences onto an existing phylogenetic tree quickly and accurately. This allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in the context of known data, making it particularly useful for analyzing large datasets or tracking genetic variations over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features of USHER**\n",
    "- Speed: Processes large datasets quickly, even in real-time.\n",
    "- Scalability: Handles complex phylogenies with thousands of sequences.\n",
    "- Integration: Accepts input in common formats (e.g., VCF, Newick).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Construct a Phylogenetic Tree with USHER\n",
    "1. **Prepare Input Files:**\n",
    "   - Aligned sequences in FASTA format.\n",
    "   - VCF file containing sequence variants.\n",
    "   - A reference tree in Newick format.\n"

    "## 3.3 Manage Computational Intensity Through Cloud Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud computing refers to the use of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data instead of relying on local hardware. It allows researchers to access virtually unlimited computational resources without the need to invest in expensive infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.1 Why Use Cloud Computing for Phylogenetics?\n",
    "1. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - Cloud platforms automatically adjust resources based on the size of the dataset.\n",
    "   - For example, small datasets may require minimal resources, while large datasets (thousands of sequences) can leverage more virtual CPUs or GPUs as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost-Effectiveness:**\n",
    "   - Pay-as-you-go models allow researchers to optimize costs by paying only for the resources they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accessibility:**\n",
    "   - Cloud services enable researchers to access computational resources and data from anywhere, supporting collaboration across teams and geographies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.2 How Cloud Computing Works in Phylogenetics?\n",
    "1. **Input Data:**\n",
    "- Upload your sequence data (e.g., FASTA files) to the cloud storage provided by the platform\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Set Up the Environment:**\n",
    "- Use pre-configured machine images (e.g., Ubuntu with MAFFT installed) or create your own environment.\n",
    "- Choose the instance type based on the task (e.g., high-memory machines for large alignments).\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Run the Workflow:**\n",
    "- Use tools like MAFFT for sequence alignment and USHER for tree construction.\n",
    "- Jobs can run on virtual CPUs or GPUs for faster performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Retrieve Results:**\n",
    "- Download the aligned sequences, VCF files, or constructed trees for further analysis.\n"
