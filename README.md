### **Overview**
The study and understanding of phylogenetic trees have become an indispensable part of modern biological research. Phylogenetic trees provide profound insights into the evolutionary relationships between species, genes, or populations. They also help in understanding the spread of diseases, including:

- The origin and evolution of pathogens.
- The time and space distribution of disease prevalence.
- The prediction of pathogen transmission trends.
  
Additionally, phylogenetic trees are used to study functional genomics, such as:
- The emergence of new anatomical structures (body plans), which define the overall organization of an organism's body.
- Metabolism and molecular adaptation.
- Morphological character evolution.
- Demographic changes in recently diverged species
  
The advancement of sequencing technologies has significantly enhanced phylogenetic analysis, enabling the study of large datasets, including whole genomes. Overall, phylogenetic trees play a crucial role in various biological disciplines, offering valuable insights into evolutionary history and functional genomics.


### **Learning Objectives:**
These submodules cover the end-to-end workflow of a standard phylogenetic analysis, starting at extracting a gene sequence to creating a phylogenetic tree to analyzing the tree.
The phylogenetic analysis modules will serve for undergraduate through graduate level.

**Provide the knowledge and tools to conduct comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for disease dynamics:**

This learning objective aims to provide participants with the knowledge and skills needed to utilize phylogenetic trees in understanding the spread of diseases. By the end of this module, participants will be able to trace the origin and evolution of pathogens, analyze the distribution of disease prevalence over time and space, and predict trends in pathogen transmission using phylogenetic analysis.

**Apply Phylogenetic Analysis to Functional Genomics and Evolutionary Studies:**

This learning objective is designed to enable participants to apply phylogenetic analysis to study the functional genomics of various species. Participants will learn how to investigate the emergence of new body plans, molecular adaptations, and morphological character evolution, as well as understand demographic changes in recently diverged species through the construction and interpretation of phylogenetic trees.

### Submodule 1: Understanding the Basics of Phylogenetics

In this submodule, learners will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of phylogenetic trees, which represent evolutionary relationships among species or organisms. These trees are based on physical traits and genetic data, help generate hypotheses  about the evolutionary history of the organisms studied. This submodule sets the foundation for subsequent modules by establishing a clear understanding of how phylogenetic trees are constructed and their significance in evolutionary studies.

#### Key Topics Covered:
- **Definition and Purpose of Phylogenetic Trees**: Understanding how they map evolutionary connections, trace genetic changes, and study biodiversity.
- **Types of Phylogenetic Trees**: Learn about rooted and unrooted trees, cladograms, phylograms, and dendrograms.
- **Data Sources for Phylogenetic Trees**: Explore various sources like genetic sequences, public databases, and sequencing technologies for constructing phylogenetic trees.
- **Applications of Phylogenetic Trees**: Insights into their role in evolutionary biology, biodiversity research, and disease tracking.



### Submodule 2: Collect and Prepare Sequence Data for Analysis

This submodule demonstrates the process of efficiently sourcing and preparing genetic sequence data for phylogenetic tree analysis, focusing on practical tools and publicly available datasets.

- **Introduction to Data Collection and Preparation**  

  Learners will be introduced to systematic methods for gathering and organizing sequence data required for phylogenetic analysis. This module emphasizes the importance of data readiness by leveraging public repositories such as **NCBI, KEGG, and UniProt**. Efficient collection and structuring of sequence data are crucial steps in constructing phylogenetic trees. By the end of this submodule, learners will gain hands-on experience in sourcing, filtering, and preparing sequence data for constructing accurate phylogenetic trees. Additionally, they will learn best practices for organizing data and leveraging public datasets to enhance their analyses.
