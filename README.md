## **Overview**
This README should walk the learner through the background and steps necessary to complete this training module. To use our module, clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/bicbioeng/nosi-phylogeny-draft.git` and then navigate to the directory for this project.

The study and understanding of phylogenetic trees have become an indispensable part of modern biological research. Phylogenetic trees provide profound insights into the evolutionary relationships between. They also help in understanding the spread of diseases, such as the origin and evolution of pathogens, the time and space distribution of prevalence, and the prediction of pathogen transmission trends. Additionally, phylogenetic trees are used to study the functional genomics of various species, including the emergence of new body plans or metabolism, molecular adaptation, morphological character evolution, and demographic changes in recently diverged species. The advancement of sequencing technologies has greatly contributed to the analysis of phylogenetic trees, allowing for the analysis of large datasets, including whole genomes. Overall, phylogenetic trees play a crucial role in various biological disciplines, providing valuable insights into the evolutionary history and functional genomics of organisms.

This README describes the tutorials in our step-by-step analytic workflow. These submodules cover the end-to-end workflow of a standard phylogenetic analysis, starting at extracting a gene sequence to creating a phylogenetic tree to analyzing the tree.


## **Learning Objectives:**
The phylogenetic analysis modules will serve for undergraduate through graduate level.

L01: Comprehensive Phylogenetic Analysis for Disease Dynamics
This learning objective aims to provide participants with the knowledge and skills needed to utilize phylogenetic trees in understanding the spread of diseases. By the end of this module, participants will be able to trace the origin and evolution of pathogens, analyze the distribution of disease prevalence over time and space, and predict trends in pathogen transmission using phylogenetic analysis.

L02: Phylogenetics in Functional Genomics and Evolutionary Studies
This learning objective is designed to enable participants to apply phylogenetic analysis to study the functional genomics of various species. Participants will learn how to investigate the emergence of new body plans, molecular adaptations, and morphological character evolution, as well as understand demographic changes in recently diverged species through the construction and interpretation of phylogenetic trees.
