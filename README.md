### **Overview**
This README should walk the learner through the background and steps necessary to complete this training module. To use our module, clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/bicbioeng/nosi-phylogeny-draft.git` and then navigate to the directory for this project.

The study and understanding of phylogenetic trees have become an indispensable part of modern biological research. Phylogenetic trees provide profound insights into the evolutionary relationships between. They also help in understanding the spread of diseases, such as the origin and evolution of pathogens, the time and space distribution of prevalence, and the prediction of pathogen transmission trends. Additionally, phylogenetic trees are used to study the functional genomics of various species, including the emergence of new body plans or metabolism, molecular adaptation, morphological character evolution, and demographic changes in recently diverged species. The advancement of sequencing technologies has greatly contributed to the analysis of phylogenetic trees, allowing for the analysis of large datasets, including whole genomes. Overall, phylogenetic trees play a crucial role in various biological disciplines, providing valuable insights into the evolutionary history and functional genomics of organisms.

This README describes the tutorials in our step-by-step analytic workflow. These submodules cover the end-to-end workflow of a standard phylogenetic analysis, starting at extracting a gene sequence to creating a phylogenetic tree to analyzing the tree.

### Submodule 1: Understanding the Basics of Phylogenetics

In this submodule, learners will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of phylogenetic trees, which represent evolutionary relationships among species or organisms. These trees are based on physical traits and genetic data and serve as hypotheses about the evolutionary history of the organisms studied.

#### Key Topics Covered:
- **Definition and Purpose of Phylogenetic Trees**: Understanding how they map evolutionary connections, trace genetic changes, and study biodiversity.
- **Types of Phylogenetic Trees**: Learn about rooted and unrooted trees, cladograms, phylograms, and dendrograms.
- **Data Sources for Phylogenetic Trees**: Explore various sources like genetic sequences, public databases, and sequencing technologies for constructing phylogenetic trees.
- **Applications of Phylogenetic Trees**: Insights into their role in evolutionary biology, biodiversity research, and disease tracking.

This submodule sets the foundation for subsequent modules by establishing a clear understanding of how phylogenetic trees are constructed and their significance in evolutionary studies.

### Submodule 2: Collect and Prepare Sequence Data for Analysis

This submodule demonstrates the process of efficiently sourcing and preparing genetic sequence data for phylogenetic tree analysis, focusing on practical tools and publicly available datasets.

#### Key Topics Covered:

**Introduction to Data Collection and Preparation**  

  Learners will be introduced to systematic methods for gathering and organizing sequence data required for phylogenetic analysis. This module emphasizes the importance of data readiness by leveraging public repositories such as **NCBI, KEGG, and UniProt**. Efficient collection and structuring of sequence data are crucial steps in constructing phylogenetic trees.  

**Efficient Methods for Retrieving Sequence Data**  

  This module provides step-by-step guidance on obtaining sequence datasets using both graphical user interfaces (GUI) and command-line tools:  
  - **NCBI Virus Database**: Search, filter, and download nucleotide sequences using metadata like taxonomy ID, collection date, and geographic location.  
  - **Entrez Direct (CLI)**: Automate sequence retrieval using command-line queries to fetch specific datasets.  
  - **Public Data Sources**: Retrieve protein sequences from **UniProt**, which offers comprehensive protein sequence and functional data.  

**Working with Key Dataset**  

  Learners will work with the following dataset:  
  - **`sequences.fasta`** â€“ A comprehensive dataset containing full nucleotide sequences for phylogenetic analysis. This dataset includes genetic sequences collected from **01/01/2023 to 03/31/2023** for the **South Dakota region of the USA**.  

By the end of this submodule, learners will gain hands-on experience in sourcing, filtering, and preparing sequence data for constructing accurate phylogenetic trees. Additionally, they will learn best practices for organizing data and leveraging public datasets to enhance their analyses.

### Submodule 3: Construct Phylogenetic Tree

In this submodule, learners will walk through the process of constructing a phylogenetic tree from gene sequence data. The key steps include performing sequence alignment and reconstructing the phylogenetic tree using different talgorithms and tools.
