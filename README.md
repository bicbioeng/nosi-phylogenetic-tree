## Overview

The study and understanding of phylogenetic trees have become an indispensable part of modern biological research. Phylogenetic trees provide profound insights into the evolutionary relationships between species, genes, or populations. They also help in understanding the spread of diseases, including:

- The origin and evolution of pathogens.
- The time and space distribution of disease prevalence.
- The prediction of pathogen transmission trends.

Additionally, phylogenetic trees are used to study functional genomics, such as:

- The emergence of new anatomical structures (body plans), which define the overall organization of an organism's body.
- Metabolism and molecular adaptation.
- Morphological character evolution.
- Demographic changes in recently diverged species

The advancement of sequencing technologies has significantly enhanced phylogenetic analysis, enabling the study of large datasets, including whole genomes. Overall, phylogenetic trees play a crucial role in various biological disciplines, offering valuable insights into evolutionary history and functional genomics.

## Background

These submodules cover the end-to-end workflow of a standard phylogenetic analysis, starting at extracting a gene sequence to creating a phylogenetic tree to analyzing the tree.
The phylogenetic analysis modules will serve for undergraduate through graduate level.

**Provide the knowledge and tools to conduct comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for disease dynamics:**

This learning objective aims to provide participants with the knowledge and skills needed to utilize phylogenetic trees in understanding the spread of diseases. By the end of this module, participants will be able to trace the origin and evolution of pathogens, analyze the distribution of disease prevalence over time and space, and predict trends in pathogen transmission using phylogenetic analysis.

**Apply Phylogenetic Analysis to Functional Genomics and Evolutionary Studies:**

This learning objective is designed to enable participants to apply phylogenetic analysis to study the functional genomics of various species. Participants will learn how to investigate the emergence of new body plans, molecular adaptations, and morphological character evolution, as well as understand demographic changes in recently diverged species through the construction and interpretation of phylogenetic trees.
